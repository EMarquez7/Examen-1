# ***Simulation of Financial Processes***
## ***Exam 1*** <br>

## **Description:**
This repository contains the solutions implemented for the 1st Exam of the course Simulation of Financial Processes - *Fall 2021* in [ITESO](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/iteso-universidad-jesuita-de-guadalajara) university. 
<br>
It contains MonteCarlo simulations in order to obtain Expected values, probabilities and other useful insights about the following games:  
- 1. Bet on Tossing a Coin repeatedly and win a prize when the difference equals 3(Heads/Tails). 
- 2. MonteCarlo simulations on a Game of Dices that sum the results in order to determine if the player wins, losses or rerolls
- 3. Monty Hall Problem: there are three doors behind one door is a valuable prize; Behind the other two, goats. You choose a door and the host opens another door with a goat<br>
     Â¿Would there be an advantage to changing the first door chosen?
- 4. By generating random traingles inside a circle, determine the probability that the 3 random points generate an acute triangle.
